This is the Codebook for the Run_Analysis.R file.

This code book contains the explanation for all the variables and data points which are seen in the Tidy data set in the same folder.

Here is the list of the Variables which are included in the Itdy data set:

This is the Variable for recognising which subject/person performed the activity in the next column.

The variables give mean of standard deviations in X, y and Z axes for total body acceleration, acc caused by gravity, acceleration caused by jerky movments, and same set of observations as above for gyroscopic measurements. Same measurements are taken for full body measurements and the mean frequencies are also calculated. These variables are just the std measurements for the values for which mean is calculated above.
